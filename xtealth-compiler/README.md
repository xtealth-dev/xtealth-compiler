 XTEALTH Compiler

XTEALTH is a powerful, cross-platform programming language compiler designed to compile code written in the XTEALTH programming language. It offers advanced features like Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, error handling, optimization passes, and easy integration with C++ bindings. This compiler is built to support a range of applications, from system-level programming to mobile app development.

 Features

- Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes and analyzes source code to generate meaningful tokens.
- Syntax Parsing: Parses the source code to build a syntax tree based on the XTEALTH grammar.
- Intermediate Code Generation: Converts parsed code into an intermediate representation.
- Optimization: Optimizes intermediate code for performance improvements.
- Code Generation: Converts optimized intermediate code into machine code.
- Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: Compile code dynamically at runtime for performance enhancements.
- Linking: Link compiled code with external libraries and resources.
- Cross-Platform: Designed to work on various platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.

 Installation

 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- CMake (for building C++ bindings)
- GCC or Clang (for compiling C++ code)

 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/xtealth-compiler.git
cd xtealth-compiler
```

 2. Install Python Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary Python dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

 3. Build the Compiler

In the project directory, run the following command to build the compiler and related components:

```bash
python3 setup.py install
```

 4. Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify that the XTEALTH compiler is installed correctly by running:

```bash
xtealth-compiler --help
```

This should display the help information for the XTEALTH compiler, indicating that the installation was successful.

 Usage

 Compiling XTEALTH Code

Once installed, you can compile XTEALTH code using the following command:

```bash
xtealth-compiler your_code.xth
```

This will compile `your_code.xth` and output an executable or an object file depending on the settings in your project.

 Running the Compiler

You can use the `xtealth-compiler` command to compile, analyze, and execute XTEALTH code directly from the command line:

```bash
xtealth-compiler run your_code.xth
```

This will run the compiled output of the XTEALTH source code directly.

 Example Code

Here is a simple XTEALTH code example:

```xtealth
// Hello World Program
func main() {
    print("Hello, XTEALTH!")
}
```

You can save the code to a file called `hello.xth` and compile it with:

```bash
xtealth-compiler hello.xth
```

 Command-Line Options

- `xtealth-compiler --help`: Display available commands and options.
- `xtealth-compiler run <file>`: Compile and run a XTEALTH program.
- `xtealth-compiler <file>`: Compile a XTEALTH program and generate an executable.
